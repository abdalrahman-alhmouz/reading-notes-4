# Props and State

## Props  
 - Props are arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.  
 - React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML  

## State  
 The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.  

## Forms  
 work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.  

## One Way Data flow  
 state can passed from parent component through props it is the idea if data flow this data flow passed down the component tree if you want to pass a data to a parent this function pass to child.  

## Handling Events  
 - There are some syntax differences:
    - React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.  
    - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
