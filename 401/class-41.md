# React Native 
  - React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.  

  - It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.  

  - You write your code in Javascript and it get's rendered natively.  

## ExpoKit  
  - ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.  
 - Expo apps are written in pure JS and never "drop down" to the native iOS or Android layer.
