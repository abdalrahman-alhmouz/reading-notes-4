# Authentication + Role Based Authorization  
 we use it when we want to know :  
   - Is this a valid user (are they logged in)?  
   - Whatâ€™s in the token?  
   - Contact between the UI and the API  


## Role-based access control  
  Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control.  
  The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.  

## Benefits of RBAC  
 - Reducing administrative work and IT support.  
 - Maximizing operational efficiency.  
 - Improving compliance.
