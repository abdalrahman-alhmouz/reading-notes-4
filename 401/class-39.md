# Redux - Additional Topics  
 
## Redux Toolkit  
  The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a “Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated” framework for making stores called the **Redux Toolkit**  

  - Simple :  
    Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.  

  - Opinionated :  
    Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.  

  - Powerful :  
    Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.  

  - Effective :  
    Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.
