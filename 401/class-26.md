# Component Based UI  
 - like React, Angular, and Vue got similar architectural principles.  
 - The application is a composition of components that work together.  
 - It depends on how they work together. Classes and functions are used to classify functionality. Require only what is needed.  
 - Render it where we want it. Keep an eye on the state and react as it changes.  

## React  
 It is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications.  

## JSX 
 - JSX is a syntax extention to Javascript and it’s used with react  
 - We use JSX because it combines both markup and javascript, so we have markup and logic in the same place.  
- JSX prevents injection attacks so it’s safe to embed user input in JSX.  

## SASS
  Syntactically awesome style sheets  
   is a powerful professional grade CSS extension language.   Because stylesheets are getting larger and more complex, sass gives features like nesting, variables, inheritance, and other features that do not exist in CSS yet.
