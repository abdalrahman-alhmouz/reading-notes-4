# Application State with Redux  
  
## Redux Store  
  - Ultimately, the “store” is where your application state is, well, stored.  
  The store’s job is to identify the various reducers and middleware that need to be made available and used globally.  
  - React uses “reducers” to hold and manage state. Reducers typically manage just one part of the larger application state.  
  For example, in a storefront application, you would likely have a separate reducer for Products, Categories, and Carts  

## use of redux  
 manage the state of your application in a predictable way redux can share the state to other components with having data flow between the parent and child  

## Good points about Jest:  
 - easily setup and start testing.  
 - Ability to run tests in parallel.  
 - Snapshot testing.  
 - Jest uses Jasmine for assertion  
 - Code coverage is available right out of the box.  
 - In-built Manual mocking
